# My R projects of Workshop

I took a free workshop for all students in the city of Pune, Maharashtra and explained them the process of designing and developing different R projects. The above projects were explained in detail
 by me during my workshop.

I have decided to open source my work for the greater good of people who are either new or trying to make various R Projects.
